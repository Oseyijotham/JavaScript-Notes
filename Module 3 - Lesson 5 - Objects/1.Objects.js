//Shorthand properties
/*Sometimes, when creating an object, you need to take the PROPERTY VALUE from a

The syntax in the following example is too awkward because you have to duplicate

you do not know, as it is stored as the value of a variable or as the result of a function.

Previously, you needed to create an object and then add properties through square brackets, which 
is not very convenient.*/
